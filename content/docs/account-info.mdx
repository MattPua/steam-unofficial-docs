## Steam ID

A Steam ID is a unique identifier for a user on the Steam platform. It is used to identify a user when making requests to the Steam API.

An easy way to find your steam ID is to visit [Steam ID Check](https://steamidcheck.com/) and enter the link to your Steam profile.

**Alternatively:**

Open your Steam Client and in the topmost menu go under "Friends" -> "Add a friend"

When it opens it will show your User ID as "Your Friend Code"

Your friend code is your Steam ID.
